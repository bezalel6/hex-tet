# Hex-Tet Alignment Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Grid Generation (FIXED)
- The hex grid correctly generates 61 cells for a 5x5 configuration
- Coordinate range is -4 to 4 (correct)
- Each edge has exactly 5 cells as expected

### 2. ✅ Coordinate System (FIXED)
- Added `hexToPixelWithGap()` function for proper spacing
- Created `getGridBounds()` for accurate viewport calculation
- Center cell (0,0) is correctly at position (0,0)
- Edge cells are correctly positioned

### 3. ✅ Configuration System (FIXED)
- Created centralized `GRID_CONFIG` in `src/config/grid.config.ts`
- Standardized cell sizes: 28px for board, 20px for piece previews
- Proper gap handling (2px)

### 4. ⚠️ Drag and Drop (PARTIALLY FIXED)
- ✅ Fixed valid placement highlighting (now shows only hovered cell)
- ✅ Added DragOverlay component
- ❌ Droppable detection not working (getting undefined coordinates)
- ❌ Piece-to-grid alignment during drag needs work

### 5. ✅ Debug Features Added
- Coordinate labels on each hex cell
- Center cell highlighted in lighter gray
- Origin markers (yellow circle and crosshairs)
- Console logging for grid generation and positioning

## Remaining Issues

1. **Droppable Detection**: The `event.over` is returning undefined during drag operations
2. **Visual Alignment**: Pieces don't visually align with grid cells during drag
3. **Coordinate Mapping**: The hovered cell detection seems off

## Debug Tools Created

1. `debug-hex-grid.test.ts` - Basic grid analysis
2. `debug-piece-alignment.test.ts` - Detailed piece alignment testing
3. `analyze-screenshots.mjs` - Screenshot analysis script
4. `test-final-state.mjs` - Interactive testing with visible browser

## Next Steps

1. Fix the droppable detection issue by debugging the dnd-kit setup
2. Ensure proper coordinate mapping between mouse position and hex cells
3. Fine-tune the visual alignment of pieces during drag
4. Remove debug visualizations once everything works correctly
